* Adjust thermostat
* **Make sure the presenter is aware and okay with being recorded**

### OBS
* Change stream template (if applicable)
* Change stream key (if applicable)
* Set talk title and speaker name in OBS.
  * **Do not do this by clicking on anything on the slide itself!** 
  * Clicking on the slide may inadvertently move text around, and it is hard to change back. 
  * Instead, double-click on the appropriate element in the *Sources* section to change it. 
  * Suggested format:
    * Talk title: `<title>`
    * Speaker name: `<speaker name> | <user group name>`
  * Source for text: https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/

### Twitch
* Open [dashboard](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma/dashboard/live):
  * Source for text: https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/
  * Set Title: `Title - Speaker Name: Group Name`
  * Set Go Live Notification: `Group Name` is live on Twitch!
  * Set Category: `Science & Technology`
    * If there is a popular category that is more applicable, change to that instead
  * Set Tags appropriately. 
    * Recommended: `Educational`, `Software Development`, `Tutorial`, `Web Development`
    * If there are more applicable [Tags](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags) in future, adjust  accordingly
    * `3D Printing`, `Engineering`, and `Robotics` may apply for OKC OSH
    * `Design` and `Graphic Design`, especially for OKC Design Tech
    * `Game Development` for OK Game Devs
  * Confirm Language: `English`

### Camera
* Turn on camera and remove lens cap
* Raise camera above crowd if necessary
* Ask speaker to stand at the lectern, and make sure he or she is in focus.
* The top of the speaker's head should be at the top of the frame.
* Make sure speakers are framed PRIOR to going live

### Microphone
* Replace the battery in the microphone
* **Turn on microphone and check for input (moving green bar) in OBS client**
    * If the green bar isn't moving, unplug the USB on the back of the mixer board and plug it back in.
    * Besides making sure that the microphone is unmuted in OBS, also mute any
      audio sources that you don't intend to record, which is typically
      everything except the microphone, unless the presentation has audio/video,
      in which cause that audio source should be unmuted and tested.
    * Make sure the Mic/Aux slider is set at 100% (all the way to the right).

* Position the microphone so that it's close to and pointed towards the speaker's mouth
  
### Starting the Stream
* Set start time in Snaz (generally 5-15 minutes after the meetup starts; if the
  user group leader doesn't have a preference 5 minutes usually works well)
* Make sure countdown is up in live frame and start streaming
* **Test the microphone and listen to the audio on Twitch**
    * If no audio on Twitch, unplug the USB on the back of the mixer board and plug it back in.

### Slides
* Turn on projectors and presenter screen
* Request speakers turn off display tools like F.lux
* Project slides to the appropriate Display # in OBS
* Make sure slides are functioning and visible on both projector screens

### Chromecast (not used for now)
* Open Google Chrome 
* Right click or go to the menu, then select `Cast`
* Select `Cast to` and change the source to `desktop`
* Select the screen showing the slides
* **Unselect the share audio checkbox**

### Twitch Chat
* During the meetup, post [messages](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/) in the chat every few minutes.
* If there are questions, relay them to the speaker.

### Ending the Stream
* Switch to the *Ending* slide in OBS and leave it for 30 seconds.
* Update the talk title and speaker name in OBS for the [next scheduled broadcast](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/).
* Click `Stop Streaming` in OBS and confirm that you want to stop the stream.
* Update the stream title and go live notification in the [dashboard](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma/dashboard/live) for the [next scheduled broadcast](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/).
* Make sure mic is turned off
* Charge the mic battery if you didn't do that before the stream
* Make sure camera is turned off and lens cap is on
* Turn projectors and presenter TV off.

### Things to know
* The crowd doesn't have a mic! Ask the speaker to repeat questions before answering them.
* Leave extra time, or ask for questions early, from Twitch/stream audience. They may be typing
  a question without giving you a notice that they have a question to ask.
* Switch to slides&audience if you need to adjust the primary camera. Do not adjust the camera while it is live. Be careful not to bump into the tripod.
* Don't use the lavalier mic.
* Copyrighted music cannot be played

### Troubleshooting
* If no audio on Twitch, unplug the USB on the back of the mixer board and plug it back in.
* To increase stream volume but not house volume, just slowly move the mic (ch. 4) fader up (which affects both house + stream) while moving the Main fader down at the same time to compensate & keep house volume steady.
